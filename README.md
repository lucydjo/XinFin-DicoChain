Go to the "List of Words" page to see the words that have already been purchased by XinFin users. If you have purchased any, you will appear in the list.

Go to the "Buy Word" page to buy a word and become its owner. The minimum purchase price is 1 XDC. If someone else wants to buy a word from you, they will have to spend at least 1 XDC more than you. **Example**:

User-A buy "Hello" for 1 XDC.  
User-B buy "Hello" for 2 XDC --> User-A receive 2 XDC  
User-C buy "Hello" for 50 XDC --> User-B receive 50 XDC
